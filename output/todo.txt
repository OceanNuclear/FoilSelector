____Short:
Check for overlaps
Find thickness that saturates detector (i.e. an upper limit)
Find thickness when error becomes too big (i.e. a lower limit)
Melting point checker
What to do with lower energy peaks?
Save the reusable outputs e.g. efficiencies, intensities, decay correction factor,  into a dictionary (json)
____Medium:
Save rdict, dec_r into a pickle object such that they can be opened later for re-collapsing the things.
	reopen the rdict file, and collapse to find the max. thickness for each bin and each reaction.
	Print self shielding factor warning just before doing that
Change library: Carlo's choice (TENDL?)
Change group structure to fit Robin's needs
	Examine what group structure may be needed for ChipIR
Do the convolution function
	Self shielding: calculate max. thickness allowable such that all bins' contribution remains reasonable.
FISPACT decay correction factor
____Long:
FISPACT: read MT=10 and 33.
Do regularization unfolding later
Print self shielding factor warning
